# Hydratation and water management in bad situations
## Dehydration 
- After heavy dehydration the person will no longer feel tirst
- Check the color of the urine (transparent hydrated, darker dehydrated)
- Things that lead to dehydration: high attitude, hot weather, humidity, physical labor, cold
- Medium: Constipation, dizziness, dry skin, tiredness
- Severe: irritability and confusion, little or no urination, fever, rapid heartbeat/breathing, dry skin/doesn't bounce back when pinched, sunken eyes, delirium
- Side effects: heat exhaustion/cramps/stroke, seizures, hypovolemic shock, cerebral edema, kidney failure 

## Electrolyte drinks for dehydration
### Var-1
- 2 quarts water
- 5-10 teaspoons sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 salt substitute (potassium salt)
### Var 2
- 1 quart water
- 250ml orange juice 
- 3 tablet spoon lemon juice
- 3/4 teaspoon salt

## water related illnesses
- Amoebic dysentery
water contaminated with harmful bacteria (the parasite Entamoeba hystolytica). Common in places when human feces are used as fertilizer for food. Symptoms 2-4 weeks after expotion (abdominal bloating, abdominal tenderness, chills, dehydration, explosive/bloody diarrhea, fatigue, frequent flatulence, enlargement of the liver, jaundice, pain in the upper-right quadrant of the abdomen)
- Dysentery/shigellosis
When large number of people share an area with poor sanitation.
(abdominal cramps, bloody stools, dehydration, fever, mucus in stools, rectal tenesmus). Careful sanitation to stop it from spreading.
- E. coli infecton 
From contact with fecal and by eating meat that hasn't been cooked thoroughly. (diarrhea/watery bloody, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain/cramps | 4 weeks -> Posibility to extent from week 2 -> anemia, blindness, clotting disorders, coma, inability to move one side of the body, intellectual disability, irritability, long term nervous system complication, low platelets in the bloodstream, pale skin, small amounts of urine, renal kidney failure, seizures, slowness of movement, small dark patches or dots on the skin, tiredness, anemia)
- Hepatitis A
may be cause by a flood in water system, happens at fecal digestion, contagious. (abdominal pain, abrupt onset of fever, fatigue, jaundice, joint pain, light clay-colored stood, loose of appetite, nausea, weakness | anywhere from a week to several months)
- viral gastroenteritis
Virus. Situation when hygiene and sanitation are an issue (abdominal pain/cramps, chills, clammy skin, diarrhea, fever, joint/muscle pain, nausea, perspiration, vomiting)
- Cholera
From contaminated food/water. Founded in feces of infected creatures. People can die within hours from onset symptoms (rapid loss of fluids | less than 1% if proper rehydration). Urgent hydration is needed (large amount of hydration solution with water, sugar and salt). (Dehydration, labored breathing, leg cramps, low blood pressure, profuse watery diarrhea, shock, vomiting, coma).
- typhoid
From bacteria Salmonella typhi. Deathly. Carriers can show no symptoms. To avoid spreading of bacteria, extracook the food and boil the water. Eat it while still hot (abdominal pain, chest congestion, enlarge spleen and liver, fatigue and weakness, headache, intestinal bleeding, rash with flat rose colored spots, very high fever (39GC).
- Leptospirosis
Transmissible from animals (asymptomatic) to humans. Transmissible by urine/other body fluids. (abdominal pain, chills, diarrhea, headache, high fever, jaundice, muscle aches, rash, red eyes, vomiting)
